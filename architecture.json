  "cover_prompt": "A man's weathered hand cradles a smooth, ordinary river stone, his thumb tracing its imperfections with reverence, while the reflection in a vast, pristine window behind him reveals a monolithic, minimalist city of gleaming white towers and silent levitating transports. The scene is set in a sterile, hyper-efficient apartment where the only object on a vast empty shelf is this stone, its tactile, organic form a stark rebellion against the seamless, digital environment. In the atmospheric style of Simon Stålenhag and Beeple, blending melancholic futurism with hyper-realistic detail, capturing the weight of memory against a cold, optimized world. Book cover framing, centered composition with a dramatic low-angle shot looking up at the man's focused profile against the oppressive cityscape, emphasizing the small stone as a monumental focal point. Cinematic chiaroscuro lighting with a stark contrast between the warm, intimate glow on the hand and stone and the cold, uniform LED ambiance of the city, using a palette of desaturated blues and whites punctuated by the earthy ochres and grays of the stone. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
