### Story Entry Points

- A group of 'Assetless' individuals develop a secret language based on the textures and weights of forbidden physical objects.
- A system glitch causes a high-rating citizen to be temporarily reassigned to basil cultivation; describe their sensory and existential shock.

### Technical Entry Points
